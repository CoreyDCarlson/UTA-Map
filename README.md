# UTA-Map
Interactive Map of UTA

Byte Map Makers - Abel, Eli, Matthew, Corey, Johnathan (Group 1)

Description
  This UTA Campus Map will be a more interactive and user-friendly version of the
  existing campus map, and it will allow users to more easily identify and locate where a
  specific building is by either its full name or the abbreviation. On MyMav, class locations
  are given with the abbreviation only, and oftentimes, new students do not know what
  these mean. This will especially help students during the first few weeks of the semester
  when they need to find new buildings.

Functionality
  1. Show a map of UTA with the building shapes and locations
  2. Each building shows its full name as well as its abbreviations
  3. Allow users to search for a specific building on the campus
  4. Scroll around the map
  5. Zoom in and out on the map
  6. *Possibly* allow users to highlight buildings of certain functions, such as “Engineering,” “Science,” “Community,” and “Housing”

External Implementations
  Google Maps API and possibly GPS
